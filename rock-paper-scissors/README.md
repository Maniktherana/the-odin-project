## Overview

### The challenge

- We‚Äôre going to make a simple implementation of grade-school classic ‚Äúrock paper scissors‚Äù. If you don‚Äôt know what that is check the Wikipedia article or this ridiculous step-by-step. For the moment we‚Äôre just going to play the game from the browser console, but we will revisit this project in a later lesson and add a Graphical User Interface with buttons and text, so don‚Äôt forget to keep the code on GitHub! You might notice some ‚ÄòLive Preview‚Äô links in the student solutions that have a GUI - this is coming in a later lesson. When you get there don‚Äôt forget to come back and add your link!

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- JavaScript
- DOM manipulation

### What I learned

* JavaScript.
* HTML DOM manipulation with Javascript.
* Modals in HTML.

```html
<!-- Modal -->
    <div class="modal" id="modal">
        <div class="modal-content" id="result">
            <span id="winner-congrats">You Win !! </span>
            <button class="restart-game" id="restart">Restart</button>
        </div>
    </div>
```
```css
.modal {
    display: none;
}
```
```js
if(gameOver()){
        modal.style.display = 'block'
        if (scoreBoard.computer === 5) {
            winnerFinal.textContent = 'Computer Wins !!'
        } else if (scoreBoard.player === 5) {
            winnerFinal.textContent = 'You Win !!'
        }
    }
}
```

### Continued development

This project made me realize that JavaScript is not as easy as it seems on the surface when getting user input is involved. I plan to do more projects involving JavaScript and DOM manipulation. 

I also intent on improving my documentation techniques and even adding JSDocs to my projects

### Useful resources

- The Odin Project's [Course](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/foundations/courses/foundations/lessons/dom-manipulation) - This helped me understand how to carry out DOM manipulation.
- Brad Traversy's [Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WR_pWXJZiRY) - This is an amazing video that also taught me how to incorporate a modal into my project.
